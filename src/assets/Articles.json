Using performance data of more than 600 hedge funds, we applied standard portfolio theory to design portfolios with optimized risk and return features. Tradable FOF products with low risk, high return and high Sharpe Ratio were described in detail, with outstanding performances confirmed by systematic backtest and robust tests. Collectively, our results offer a sound investing product based on Chinese hedge fund performance, and are valuable both as an independent product and as a major component in a more comprehensive portfolio.</p>",

Second idea evaluates the opportunities implied by the ETF purchase program of Bank of Japan. Third idea demonstrates the predicting effectiveness of Chinese short selling and margin buying data with feature selection. Limitations and concerns for each idea is discussed separately. With a valuation model established in the first section, we are able to value each trading idea at 1.5M, 0.46M and 0.33M USD respectively, based on derived estimates of strategy performances and investment characteristics.</p>",
